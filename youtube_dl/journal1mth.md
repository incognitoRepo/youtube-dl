## Journal for ~1month in of psychological torture
_i will start journaling from today, was stupid of me not to start this earlier_
said "you" first then "you guys"
bc we said we'd shoot you (when asked about why my dad won't tell me).
you gotta stop smoking meth bc its wafting over.
ok guys we gotta stop.
u dont have to write down everything we say.
go check on your mom and dad.
see hes good.
does the dog annoy you.
*ash*
we are with the fbi.
we have been watching you.
dang hes good.
its not working.
we gotta take him out.
you're not stupid.
he doesn't know what this is about (true)
we're just fucking with you man.
he's not scared.
he's scared.
*repeats 2 lines above*
why is there color on there (refering to the syntax highlighting)
we're not gonna stop messing with you.
ok we will stop messing with you.
did you feel that?
we're gonna take that as a yes.
ok, that can kill you.
ok, are you gonna smoke meth.
you did nothing wrong?
*repeats*

-bc u r torturing me
we're not torturing you.
yes you are stupid.

*repeats*
did u feel that?
do u feel this?
o shit he doesn't feel anything.
stop looking like that.
no, its not your camera stupid (referrig to when i looked into my imac camera)
its your dad stupid.
impersonating my dad:
"sir your son is smoking meth and it needs to stop"
"my dads voiceover / voice soundalike / whatever they are using to imitate his voice"
my mom asking my dad:
"dad, did u hear anything? bc i heard something"
please stop typing.
i'll hurt the kid.
mom, u said u'd hurt me?
o no, he's caught onto us.
we are the fbi.
no we really are the fbi.
no we are the fbi.
*repeats*
"repeats, thank you" (asking me to write "repeats")
*is still impersonating the fbi, in various ways*
who's he talking to?
he's not talking.
please dont write what i say.
please dont please dont *rpts*
your not gonna take him in?
bc he hasn't done anything wrong.

---
-im just gonna write what you say
no please dont.
-mom turns on vacuum, now u guys have a _challenge_ for whatever this circus is
hahahaha
we did not say that
-irrelevant bit about str formatting
we dont care about that
we are not torturing you
-yes, you are
we are just trying to help you (another clue that they are reading a script)
(this is someone who is an artistic at forensic/interrogrative psychology)
(there are just a few cracks in the logic but the answers it provides are, if talented enough, guessable)
you have to stop smoking meth.
listen to me.
you have to right now.
or we will call the cops.
(i shake my head no)
ok we will now.
(i shake my head yes)
*another phone call to cops role play*
*ominous voice: this isn't a role play*
he's nervous he's gonna break.
(i think it is not mind-reading but being able to echo one's own thoughts back to themselves. in different voices.)
we're gonna kill you and your family if you dont cooperate.
